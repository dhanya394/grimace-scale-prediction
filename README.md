### Face Detection and Grimace Scale Prediction of White-Furred Mice

1. Face Detection by fine-tuning pre-trained YOLO v3 model, \n
2. Eye Region Detection by creation of binary mask using dilated CNNs & \n
3. Prediction of Grimace Scale using CNNs. Models were evaluated using Mean Intersection over Union and Weighted F1-Score metrics.
